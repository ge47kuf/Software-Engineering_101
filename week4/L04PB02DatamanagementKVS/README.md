## Exercise Structure

- `filefolder.py`: Implementation of file folder `FileFolder`
- `main.py`: A simple usage scenario of file folder

In order to work with this exercise, you need to install Python on your machine. More information how to install and setup Python can be found [here](https://www.python.org/)

Once Python is installed on your machine, install the requirements for the exercise by running the following command in the exercise directory `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Optional**: If you want to have separated working environment, you can setup the virtual environment (more [details](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))

## Commands

You can test your implemenetation by running `python main.py`
